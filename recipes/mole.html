        <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth </li>

        <li>5 ounces dark chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast chipotle, guajillo, and ancho chiles in a dry 
            pan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until warm 
            and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a blender.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 cups chicken broth in a saucepan until it begins
             to simmer, about 5 minutes. Pour broth into the blender.</li>
        <li>Toast dinner roll pieces and tortilla strips in a dry pan 
            over medium heat, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 
            about 3 minutes. Transfer to the blender with chicken broth and chiles.</li>
        <li>Allow the chiles, toasted bread, and tortillas to soak, fully 
            submerged, in the chicken broth until softened, about 10 minutes. 
            Blend the mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>Cook tomatillos and tomatoes in a dry skillet on medium-high
             heat until soft and blackened, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place
              tomatoes in the blender with the chile puree.</li>
        <li>Melt lard in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, 
            garlic, peanuts, raisins, cumin seeds, thyme, allspice berries, 
            cloves, and cinnamon sticks; cook and stir until onions are 
            soft and golden, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the cinnamon sticks and 
            other whole spices; add onion mixture to the blender with the 
            chile-tomato mixture and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour chile puree into a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir 
            in 1 cup chicken broth, chocolate, sugar, and salt. Bring mixture 
            to a simmer; stir until chocolate is melted and sauce is thickened 
            and slightly reduced, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
