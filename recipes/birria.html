        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a very large pot! This recipe fills up my 7 qt dutch oven to the very top.</li>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients: halve the onion, slice the carrots, cut the tip off the garlic bulb, cut off stem of peppers and remove seeds</li>
            <li>Simmer: Add all the ingredients to the stock pot and cover with water. Add in the seasonings, except for the chili powder</li>
            <li>Skim: After 30 minutes of simmering skim the top of the broth to remove any impurities that have come out of the bones from simmering. It will look like little bits of foam on the top of the broth</li>
            <li>Blend Peppers: remove the peppers from the broth, they will be softened, add them to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Add a small amount of broth if needed to get a nice smooth texture</li>
            <li>Simmer: continue to let the stew simmer until the meat is tender and easily shreds. This takes about 3 hours or longer. Remove the lid and stir every 40 minutes or so. Taste the broth and adjust seasonings as needed during the cooking process</li>
            <li>serve this as a stew, skim the grease off the top of the broth</li>
            <li>Top with fresh diced onion, cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. The broth is thick and rich and the fresh acidity of these ingredients complement the flavoring perfectly.</li>
        </ol>
